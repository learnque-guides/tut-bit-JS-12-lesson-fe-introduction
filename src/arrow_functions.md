# Arrow functions

Functions can now be declared using a much shorter syntax.

```js
// ES5
var multiplyES5 = function(a, b) {
    return a * b;
};

// ES6
const multiplyES6 = (a, b) => { return a * b; };
```

What is the difference of those two functions declaration? How scope is passed in both functions?
