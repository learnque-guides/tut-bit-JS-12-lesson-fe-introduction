# Recursion

A recursive function is a function that calls itself, either directly or indirectly. Recursion is a powerful programming technique in which a problem is divided into a set of similar subproblems, each solved with a trivial solution. Generally, a recursive function calls itself to solve its subproblems.

```js
var factorial = function factorial(i, a) {
    a = a || 1;
    if (i < 2) {
        return a;
    }
    return factorial(i âˆ’ 1, a * i);
};

console.log((factorial(4)); // 24
```
